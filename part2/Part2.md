## PROJECT OVERVIEW

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#FFEB9C">PROBLEM OR ISSUE</th>
    <td>The core issue is to get upt to pace with new technologies (Java, Springboot, maybe a framework like Angular or a library like shad.cn) in a very short amount of time, and deliver an MVP for mi-july.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#FFEB9C">PURPOSE OF PROJECT</th>
    <td>This is a school project supposed to be an opportunity to showcase the concepts seen during the year.

  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#FFEB9C">BUSINESS CASE</th>
    <td>A very simple web application featuring cooking recipes, tagging and filtering abilities.</td>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#FFEB9C">GOALS / METRICS</th>
    <td>Fast, seamless queries. Modern, responsive, accessible client. Solid, simple back-end features.</td>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#FFEB9C">EXPECTED DELIVERABLES</th>
    <td>The project is the deliverable under the form of a GitHub repo, ready for self hosting. Deployment features using docker could be a good addition if time allows.</td>
  </tr>

## PROJECT SCOPE

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#DDEBF7">WITHIN SCOPE</th>
    <td>The MVP should be very focused : home page, login/logout, profile page, filtering abilities, interacting with API routes and DB using ORM.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th align="left" bgcolor="#DDEBF7">OUTSIDE OF SCOPE</th>
    <td>As the certification exam is focused on a modern, accessible client for a simple backend, anything outside of this perimeter should be added to a back log for future improvements. The core MVP has to remain built around the simple, yet solid and well-implemented expected features.</td>
