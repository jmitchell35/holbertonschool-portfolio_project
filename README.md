# Portfolio Project Overview: Building an MVP from scratch

## Introduction to the General Project

### Objective
This multi-stage project is designed to guide students through the process of developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) from concept to completion. Working collaboratively in stable teams, students will gain hands-on experience with each stage of the software development lifecycle, simulating a real-world environment. The project emphasizes teamwork, technical execution, documentation, and project management, culminating in a fully functional MVP.

### Importance
By working on a comprehensive project, students will:
1. Develop critical technical and soft skills, including teamwork, communication, and problem-solving.
2. Gain practical exposure to software design, architecture, and implementation.
3. Learn how to document and manage a project effectively.
4. Understand the lifecycle of a product, from ideation to closure, preparing them for professional challenges.

## Project Stages

1. **Stage 1: Team Formation and Idea Development (2 weeks)**  
   Teams will be established, and members will collaborate to brainstorm and refine a project idea. This stage focuses on group dynamics, creativity, and alignment on a shared vision.

2. **Stage 2: Project Charter (2 weeks)**  
   Teams will document their project's goals, scope, stakeholders, and risks, creating a Project Charter that serves as the foundation for their work.

3. **Stage 3: Technical Documentation (2 weeks)**  
   Teams will create a detailed technical document, including class diagrams, system architecture, and workflows, ensuring a solid technical plan for the MVP.

4. **Stage 4: MVP Development (4 weeks)**  
   The core development phase where teams will implement their MVP using modern technologies and best practices. This stage focuses on code quality, teamwork, and iteration.

5. **Stage 5: Project Closure (2 weeks)**  
   Teams will prepare a final presentation, evaluate their project outcomes, and reflect on the lessons learned, completing the lifecycle of their MVP.

## Involved Roles

* **Team Members**: Responsible for idea generation, development, and documentation.

* **Project Manager**: Oversees the project to ensure it stays on track with the plan. This role may be assigned permanently to one member or rotated among team members in each stage, allowing everyone to gain experience in project management. The project manager is responsible for organizing team meetings, monitoring progress, identifying risks, and ensuring deadlines are met.

* **Team Lead**: A leadership role within the team that may rotate as well, focusing on task coordination and technical decision-making.

* **Tutors**: Provide mentorship, evaluate deliverables, and offer feedback.

* **Project Evaluators**: Assess the final product and presentations based on the predefined rubric.

## General Resources
To help students navigate through the project phases, the following general resources are recommended:

* Articles and tutorials on Agile and Scrum methodologies.
* Guides to creating effective project charters and technical documentation.
* Introduction to UML and system architecture basics.
* Insights into the Lean Startup methodology for MVP development.
* Tutorials on collaborative tools like GitHub and Trello for project management.

This project is an opportunity to simulate professional software development practices, preparing students to thrive in collaborative and high-performance environments. Each phase builds on the previous one, fostering continuous learning and growth. Teams will not only learn technical skills but also practice effective communication and leadership, preparing them to excel in real-world projects.
