# Why ER diagram only instead of having a ClassDiagram

In the process of building the documentation for the project, I started with the class diagram before moving to the ER diagram. The ER diagram took me much farther into thinking the project through than the class diagram did. Hence I felt the need to go back over the class diagram to get it up to date and coherent with the ER. But it felt redundant, and failed to add significant value to the documentation to my eyes. I did not have significant methods to add yet, and I felt like adding the CRUD operations was just crowding the diagram. Authentication logic is no specific for a small project like this and had nothing to do with business logic. Hence I deleted it and chose to stick to the ER diagram as the main project diagram, to keep things simple.
