## Tasks

### 1.

**Purpose**: To identify and prioritize the functionalities of the MVP from the user’s perspective and visualize its interface when applicable.

**Instructions**:

*   Write **User Stories** using the format:  
    *   “As a \[user type\], I want to \[perform an action\], so that \[achieve a goal\].”  
        
    *   Prioritize stories using MoSCoW (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won’t Have).  
        
*   If the MVP includes a user interface, create **mockups** for the main screens using tools like Figma, Balsamiq, or Adobe XD.  
    
*   For API-only projects, mockups are not necessary. Instead, focus on defining clear User Stories and API interactions.  
    

**Example**:  
**User Story**:

*   As a **user**, I want to **receive real-time notifications for completed tasks**, so that I can **track my productivity effectively**.  
    **Mockup**: Create wireframes showing the notifications dashboard (if applicable).  
    

**Deliverable Section**:

*   List of prioritized User Stories.  
    
*   Mockups for main screens (if applicable).

### 2.

**Purpose**: To define how the MVP components interact and ensure scalability and efficiency.

**Instructions**:

*   Create a high-level **architecture diagram** showing components such as front-end, back-end, databases, and external services.  
    
*   Specify how data flows between components using arrows and annotations.  
    

**Example**:  
A web application architecture may include:

*   Front-end: React.  
    
*   Back-end: Node.js and Express.  
    
*   Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL.  
    
*   External APIs: OpenWeatherMap for weather data.  
    

**Deliverable Section**:

*   Diagram illustrating the architecture and data flow.

### 3.

**Purpose**: To detail the internal structure of the system components.

**Instructions**:

*   For the back-end: List and define key **classes** with their attributes and methods.  
    
*   For the database:  
    *   If using a **relational database**, create an ER diagram or schema showing tables, attributes, and relationships.  
        
    *   If using a **document-oriented database** (e.g., MongoDB), define **collections** and the structure of stored documents. Specify mandatory fields and optional fields.  
        
*   For the front-end: Outline main UI components and their interactions.  
    

**Example**:

**Relational Database**:

*   `expense` table with columns for `id`, `amount`, `category_id`, `date`.  
    

**Document-Oriented Database**:  
Collection: `expenses`

*   Document: `{ "id": 1, "amount": 100, "category": "Food", "date": "2024-01-01" }`  
    

**Deliverable Section**:

*   Component/Class descriptions.  
    
*   ER diagram, database schema, or collection structure.  
    

**Resources**:

### 4.

**Purpose**: To show how components or services interact for key use cases.

**Instructions**:

*   Identify 2-3 critical use cases (e.g., user logs in, retrieves data, saves a new record).  
    
*   Draw sequence diagrams showing interactions between components (e.g., front-end, back-end, database).  
    

**Deliverable Section**:

*   Sequence diagrams for key interactions.  
    

**Resources**:

### 5.

**Purpose**: To specify how the system interacts with external APIs and define its own API.

**Instructions**:

*   List **external APIs** the project will use, explaining why they were chosen.  
    
*   For the project’s API, define:  
    *   URL path.  
        
    *   HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).  
        
    *   Input format (JSON or query parameters).

### 6.

**Purpose**: To establish procedures for managing code, the development lifecycle, and ensuring quality.

**Instructions**:

*   Define **SCM Processes**:  
    *   Use Git or a similar tool for version control.  
        
    *   Establish branching strategies (e.g., main, development, feature branches).  
        
    *   Plan for regular commits, code reviews, and pull requests.  
        
*   Plan **QA Processes**:  
    *   Define a testing strategy (e.g., unit tests, integration tests).  
        
    *   Specify tools for testing (e.g., Jest, Postman).  
        
    *   Plan a deployment pipeline for staging and production environments.
